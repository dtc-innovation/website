    "en": "<div> Contact: pl.boulanger[AT]sciencespo.fr\r\n\r\nI spent 4 years as a Graduate assistant teacher and PhD candidate in the Philosophy Department of Paris Ouest Nanterre University, and I was a visiting graduate student in UC Berkeley thanks to Alva Noë during 2011 Spring Semester. At Nanterre, I taught classes of Methodology, Philosophy of action, Introduction to Metaphysics with Patrice Maniglier, Epistemology with Denis Forest, and Philosophy of the Body. At Sciences-Po, I taught Philosophy of sports and Political Philosophy (Subject and Power). My Dissertation, under the supervision of Stéphane Haber is entitled \"L’épreuve Sportive de Soi\" (Self-Experience in Sports) and tries to describe 6 modes of subjectification among sporting activities. Even if I enjoyed at Nanterre the best intellectual environment to write my PhD thesis, I will have to play a challenging game in 2013-2014: finish the writing of my dissertation AND moderate the fascinating contribution column of Bruno Latour's <i>Modes of existence</i> website.</div>",
