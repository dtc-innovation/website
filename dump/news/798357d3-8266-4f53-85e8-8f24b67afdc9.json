While the threats to knowledge posed by these movements are real, I argue that it would be a mistake to return to a classic intellectual strategy––the politics of demarcation––in the face of this danger. Examining practical proposals for combatting fake news and opinion manipulation on the Internet, namely so-called \"fact-checking\" tools and services, I argue that they threaten to enroll us in a problematic normative project, one that aims to re-establish a hierarchy between knowledge and its presumed opposite, non-knowledge, or anti-knowledge. Instead of consolidating hierarchies of knowledge through facts that derive their authority form outside the public sphere, we need to recover the central role in public life of experimental facts: statements whose truth value is unstable. I will then discuss an on-going study undertaken with the Public Data Lab and Liliana Bounegru in which we use lexicon-based methods and tools to analyse the robustness and vibrancy of public facts: empirical propositions circulating in public media, of which the experimental validation must partly be accomplished in the latter domain.\r\n\r\nRecommended reading: Marres, Noortje. « <a href=\"https://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/view/188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why We Can’t Have Our Facts Back</a> ». <i>Engaging Science, Technology, and Society</i> 4, n<sup>o</sup> 0 (24 juillet 2018): 423‑43.\r\n<h3>Résumé</h3>\r\nNoortje Marres is Associate Professor in the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick, and a Visiting Professor in the Centre for Science &amp; Technology Studies at the University of Leiden.
