La conférence de Katy Börner aura lieu mercredi 11 Avril de 19h30 à 20:30, en salle Eugene D'EICHTAL - A35 (27 rue Saint Guillame, 7eme arrondissement).\r\n\r\nRecent developments in data mining, information visualization, and science of science studies make it possible to study science and technology (S&amp;T) at multiple levels using a systems science approach. At the micro-level, the impact of single individuals, specific works, or legal frameworks can be examined. At the meso-level, the expertise profiles of institutions can be compared or the trajectories of student cohorts can be modeled. The macro-level provides a 10,000 foot view of the continuously evolving geospatial and topical landscape of science and technology and the global import/export activities, innovation diffusion, and brain drain unfolding over both spaces. Relevant works and maps are featured in the international Places &amp; Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit (http://scimaps.org) and the Atlas of Science (http://scimaps.org/atlas).\r\nThe first part of this talk will present research results and case studies that aim to increase our scientific understanding of the inner workings of S&amp;T. The second part introduces novel approaches and tools that improve information access, researcher networking, and research management. The talk concludes with an overview of data services and plug-and-play macroscope tools developed at the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center in support of data mining and visualization.\r\n<h3>Relevant Links</h3>\r\nVIVO National Researcher Network:<a href=\" http://vivoweb.org\" target=\"_blank\"> http://vivoweb.org</a>\r\nScholarly Database serving 25 million records: <a href=\"http://sdb.cns.iu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">http://sdb.cns.iu.edu</a>\r\nPlug-and-Play Macroscope Tools: <a href=\"http://cishell.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://cishell.org</a>\r\nReferences\r\nBörner, Katy.

She is a curator of the Places &amp; Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit (<a href=\"http://scimaps.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://scimaps.org</a>). Her research focuses on the development of data analysis and visualization techniques for information access, understanding, and management. She is particularly interested in the study of the structure and evolution of scientific disciplines; the analysis and visualization of online activity; and the development of cyberinfrastructures for large scale scientific collaboration and computation. She is the co-editor of the Springer books ‘Visual Interfaces to Digital Libraries’ (2003) and ‘Modeling Science Dynamics’ (2012) and of a special issue of PNAS on ‘Mapping Knowledge Domains’ (2004). Her book ‘Atlas of Science: Visualizing What We Know’ by MIT Press was published in 2010. She holds a MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Technology in Leipzig, 1991 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Kaiserslautern, 1997.
