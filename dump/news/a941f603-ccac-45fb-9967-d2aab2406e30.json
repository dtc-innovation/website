Thus the conference intends to break away from disciplinary divides and bring a fresh look on the key issues brought upon by the Anthropocene.\r\n\r\nThis conference will take place on Monday 4th December at Paris Descartes University, 12 rue de l'Ecole de m√©decine, 75006, Paris and on Tuesday 5th December at Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, 1 rue jussieu, 75005 Paris.\r\n\r\nFind the program of the international conference <a href=\"http://virchowvillerme.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Politics-of-the-Earth-final-conference-Programme-4-5-December-2017.pdf\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nTo attend, please do register at the following link : <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2k80Caz\">http://bit.ly/2k80Caz<img src=\"&quot;&lt;/p\" /></a>",
